    #Day 56 is about Introduction to OOP in Python...
        In programming language there are two appoachers that are used to  write program
        1) Procedural Programming
        2) Object-Oriented Programming

        The procedure we are following till now is the "Procedural Programming" approach.
        So, in this session, we will learn about Object Oriented Programming (OOP). The
        basic idea of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python is to use classes and
        objects to represent real-world concepts and entities.
        eg. 
            You are having a compitation in your college for that you want all participants
            To fill a form which have their name, branch and semister.
            for that you create a google form which will have certain coloum for name, branch
            and semister this will be considered as template or blueprint.
            While the individual student filling the form will become a object which is a 
            Real-World Entity...

        CLASS:
            A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and
            methods that an object of that class will have. Properties are the data or state of an
            object, and methods are the actions or behaviors that an object can perform.

        OBJECT:
            An object is an instance of a class, and it contains its own data and methods. For example,
            you could create a class called "Person" that has properties such as name and age, and
            methods such as speak() and walk(). Each instance of the Person class would be a unique
            object with its own name and age, but they would all have the same methods to speak and walk.

        4 pillars of OOP...
            1)Abstraction.
            2)Encapsulation.
            3)Inheritance.
            4)Polymorphism.
