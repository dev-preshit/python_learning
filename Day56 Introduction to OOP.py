"""    # Day 56 is about Introduction to OOP in Python...
        In programming languages, there are two approaches that are used to write programs:
        1) Procedural Programming
        2) Object-Oriented Programming

        The procedure we have been following until now is the "Procedural Programming" approach.
        In this session, we will learn about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The
        basic idea of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is to use classes and
        objects to represent real-world concepts and entities.
        e.g. 
            You are having a competition in your college, for which you want all participants
            to fill out a form that includes their name, branch, and semester.
            To achieve this, you create a Google form that will have certain columns for name, branch,
            and semester. This will be considered as a template or blueprint.
            While individual students filling out the form will become objects, which are 
            real-world entities...

        CLASS:
            A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and
            methods that an object of that class will have. Properties are the data or state of an
            object, and methods are the actions or behaviors that an object can perform.

        OBJECT:
            An object is an instance of a class, and it contains its own data and methods. For example,
            you could create a class called "Person" that has properties such as name and age, and
            methods such as speak() and walk(). Each instance of the Person class would be a unique
            object with its own name and age, but they would all have the same methods to speak and walk.

        The 4 pillars of OOP are:
            1) Abstraction
            2) Encapsulation
            3) Inheritance
            4) Polymorphism
